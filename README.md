This program defines two functions lcm() and gcd(). 
The lcm() function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the LCM of those numbers.
It initializes the LCM to the first number in the list and then iterates through the rest of the list, updating the LCM using the formula lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b).

The gcd() function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

The program then defines a list of numbers and calls the compute_lcm() function with that list as input. 
The resulting LCM is printed to the console.

The time complexity of this program is O(n^2) due to the nested loop in the lcm() function. 
The auxiliary space used by the program is O(1) as only a constant number of variables are used throughout the algorithm.
